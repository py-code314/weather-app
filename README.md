## Overview

This weather app is a simple web application that allows users to check the current weather conditions for any location. The app uses the Weather API by Visual Crossing to fetch weather data and display it on the app. Users can search for any location and the app will display the current weather conditions for that location. The app also provides a 7-day forecast for the location.
